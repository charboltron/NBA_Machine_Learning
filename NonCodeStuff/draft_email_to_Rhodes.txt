Prof Rhodes,

Our team:

Charles Bolton,
Pat Rademacher,
Tom Lancaster,
and myself Chad Tolleson

want to use NBA player statistics to compare the SVM and Regression techniques' performance in predicting some verifiable aspects of NBA players. The notion for this project is inspired by a few items we came across:

Kannan, Adarsh; Kolovich, Brian; Lawrence, Brandon; and Rafiqi, Sohail (2018) "Predicting National Basketball Association Success: A Machine Learning Approach," SMU Data Science Review: Vol. 1 : No. 3 , Article 7. (attached for reference)

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/ (stumbled upon this on the internet, linked only, will probably not factor into our project)

any number of the countless sports stats projects found on the internet

Our initial thought is to use this popular (25k+ downloads) dataset from Kaggle:

Right now we are leaning heavily towards implementing SVM and Regression models, and comparing their performance. Also still being thoughtfully considered is what we want to predict. We'd use the dataset and our models to predict some verifiable aspect of the players. Some of our current ideas are MVP, length of NBA career, number of trade over an NBA career, etc. We will have both the models and targets defined by next Monday.

With the dataset and chosen targets we will perform the following steps:
1) split the dataset into training and testing sets (probably 60/40 or 75/25), 
2) select some features we feel are likely to drive results (time permitting we may use all available features just to see what happens),
3) program our models and tune their related hyperparameters,
4) use the pared-down training set to train our models,
5) use the testing set to assess the models' performance,
6) and finally generate graphs and charts to represent the performance of our models.

Do you think our proposal is acceptable and sufficient for the ML group project? Do you need any further information from us, or will this e-mail suffice for our official proposal?

Thanks!

Regards,
Chad
